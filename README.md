The header has  a logo and navigation buttons. These are used to navigate to the different sections in my webpage. These are the section in this web page: Home, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact us, Gallery.
Every sections have topics and description about that.
Inside the home section, there has a image slider builded with javascript.  It allows users to view multiple images related to my theme. The slider can automatically cycle through the images.
Inside About section, there has a gallery.
Inside Contact section I have implemented form validation using JavaScript to ensure that the information provided by users through contact forms is valid. Validate fields are email addresses, numbers, or any other relevant information.
Inside Gallery section include a button that toggles the visibility of gallery.
I have added smooth scrolling functionality to my navigation links. When a user cicks on a navigation link, the page should scroll smoothly to the corresponding sectioninstead of instantly jumping to it.

**Updated**
I have built the foundation of my portfolio webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to add server-side functionality using PHP. I enhance your webpage by incorporating the following PHP features:

Form Validation and Input Sanitization: ● Implemented PHP code to validate and sanitize the following fields in my contact form: ● Display appropriate error messages if any field fails validation.
Database Integration: ● Created a MySQL database to store booking details. ● Establish a database connection. ● Insert new project details into the database. ● Retrieve project data from the database. ● Update project information. ● Delete projects if necessary.
User Authentication: ● Created a table in the database to store user account details. Include columns such as: ● Use PHP sessions to keep track of authenticated users.
PHP Functions: ● Created a PHP file named dbFunction.php to contain my custom functions. ● Wrote functions such as ● validateForm(): Perform form validation and return an array of error messages. ● connectDatabase(): Establish a database connection and return the connection object. ● insertProject(): Insert project details into the database. ● getProjects(): Retrieve project data from the database. ● updateProject(): Update project information in the database. ● deleteProject(): Delete projects from the database.

**PHP files and database are in the "MyPortfolioWeb.zip".**
**Also PHP file are in "MyWeb" and database is in "Database"**
