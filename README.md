The header has  a logo and navigation buttons. These are used to navigate to the different sections in my webpage. These are the section in this web page: Home, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact us, Gallery.
Every sections have topics and description about that.
Inside the home section, there has a image slider builded with javascript.  It allows users to view multiple images related to my theme. The slider can automatically cycle through the images.
Inside About section, there has a gallery.
Inside Contact section I have implemented form validation using JavaScript to ensure that the information provided by users through contact forms is valid. Validate fields are email addresses, numbers, or any other relevant information.
Inside Gallery section include a button that toggles the visibility of gallery.
I have added smooth scrolling functionality to my navigation links. When a user cicks on a navigation link, the page should scroll smoothly to the corresponding sectioninstead of instantly jumping to it.
